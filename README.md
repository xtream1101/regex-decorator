# Regex Decorator

This library allows you to place a decorator on a function which has a regex as an argument. Then when parsing text, if that regex is found it will run the function and optionally return data

Referance `test_parsing.py` for some basic examples

## Run tests
Just run the command `pytest` in the root directory (may need to `pip3 install pytest`)
